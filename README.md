# Mealtime Mayhem: Zookeeper Chronicles

This is our contribution for the finnish game jam 2024 (see https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/mealtime-mayhem-zookeeper-chronicles-2).

## Description

"I didn't order plain shell fish! I demand sushi!" – This is what a normal day for the zookeeper at Mayhem City can sound like. But it doesn't need to! In this transportation management chaos you feed the animals in the zoo. Remember what they want to eat, don't forget about their dietary restrictions and remember the school tour coming to visit the penguins at 11:00. Oh, and the medicine for the ice bear! And if you get it wrong, the animals might be mad. Or face it, they will be.
